# DevCameraMod
DevCameraMod is a mod for Gorilla Tag used for recording Competitive scrims and content creation. The mod was disbanded from dev due to people not updating the mod with the updates he spent tons of time on. This code is used for me for fun to help me learn c# better while improving this mod, please act as if this is private. Do not share this mod in the compiled dll form. Thank you!

# Sakuraa's Note:

Please keep in mind that I am learning C#, I have the smallest brain cells when it comes to the language. Don't come back at me angry because you don't like my changes, just use the original version of dev's mod if you dont. My discord is `Sakuraa#1930` if you have any suggestions!
